* orgformat

This is a utility library for providing functions to generate and
modify [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] syntax elements like [[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.html][links]], [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Timestamps.html#Timestamps][time-stamps]], or
date-stamps.

This file was initially written mainly by https://github.com/awieser
and was part of [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs][Memacs]].

As of 2019-10-31, this file is moved to an independent library since
multiple projects are using its functions such as:

- [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][lazyblorg]]

** Installation

This tool needs [[http://www.python.org/downloads/][Python 3 to be installed]].

You can install filetags via [[https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/][pip]]:

: pip3 install orgformat

If you are using a project that is referring to orgformat, this
library usually gets added to the =requirements.txt= file of that
project and installed when you do invoke:

: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

** Changelog

- 2019-11-03: finished moving from Memacs and lazyblorg to a separate library
